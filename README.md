# Analysis and Clustering of Stocks Price Charts using Singular Value Decomposition
In this project, we analyze the price charts of stocks on the NYSE and NASDAQ (and a few ETFs) using SVD. We use parameters extracted from the SVD matrices to group together stocks exhibiting similar price trends and to generate a 3D similarity manifold that provides a visual representation of the entire market.

You can run the program yourself with the Jupyter notebook. If you don't want to download the program and run the notebook, you should be able to see a preview of it [here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/gregory-m-mullen/stock_price_svd_analysis/blob/master/stock_price_svd_clustering.ipynb).

Examples of the types of plots resulting from the analysis are included in [this folder](https://github.com/gregory-m-mullen/stock_price_svd_analysis/tree/master/data/example_plots). They can be downloaded and opened in a web browser (Chrome works well). These plots are interactive. The data can be hidden/displayed by clicking on the names in the legend.
